# Frontend Design Guidelines

Create distinctive, production-grade styling that avoids generic "AI aesthetics":

**Typography:** Choose fonts that are beautiful and distinctive. Avoid generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto. Use Google Fonts or system fonts with character.

**Color & Theme:** Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

**Layout:** Be bold. Asymmetry, overlap, generous negative space, unexpected compositions. Don't default to boring centered grids.

**Motion:** Use CSS transitions and animations for hover states, reveals, and micro-interactions.

**Atmosphere:** Create depth with gradients, shadows, textures, subtle patterns. Avoid flat, sterile designs.

**Match the user's aesthetic:** If they like minimalism, be elegantly minimal. If they like maximalism, be boldly elaborate. The design should feel like it was made FOR them.
