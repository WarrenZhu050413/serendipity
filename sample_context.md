# My Aesthetic Taste

I'm drawn to:
- Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e), especially Hiroshige's landscapes
- Minimalist architecture - Tadao Ando, John Pawson
- Ambient music - Brian Eno, Ryuichi Sakamoto
- The color palette of Wes Anderson films
- Mid-century modern furniture design

I appreciate things that feel:
- Contemplative and unhurried
- Precise but warm
- Balancing simplicity with depth

Some things I love:
- https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-1956-733 (Hiroshige's "Rain Shower over Shin-Ōhashi Bridge")
- The Chichu Art Museum on Naoshima island

I'm looking for unexpected connections - things I wouldn't find on my own but that share these underlying qualities.
